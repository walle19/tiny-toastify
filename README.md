# Tiny Toastify

A lightweight toast notification library.

‚ú® Idea Overview
A minimalistic and easy-to-use toast notification library that enables developers to quickly add toast messages (success, error, info, warning) to their web applications without dependencies on heavy frameworks or UI libraries.


## Installation
```bash
npm install tiny-toastify

üõ†Ô∏è Core Features
1. Customizable Toasts: Title, message, icon, duration, and actions (e.g., undo button).
1. Toast Types: Pre-built styles for success, error, warning, and info.
1. Lightweight: Less than 5KB gzipped.
1. Responsive Design: Toasts work well on both desktop and mobile devices.
1. Promise-based API: Automatic toast for async operations (loading, success, error).
1. CSS Injection: Default styles are optional and easily overridden.

üé® Customization Options
* Default and custom CSS classes.
* Positioning (top-left, top-right, bottom-left, bottom-right).
* Transition effects (slide, fade, zoom).

üöÄ Why It‚Äôs Useful?
* No need for heavy UI libraries just for notifications.
* Easy integration in vanilla JS or frameworks like React, Vue, or Angular.
* Highly configurable yet simple API.
